## CLi Script

This is a PHP script that is executed from the command line, which accepts a CSV file as input (see command line directives below) and processes the CSV file. The parsed file data is to be inserted into a MySQL database if all the data contained in the CSV file is valid.

An error message will be output to explain the issue and the command can be run again once the CSV file has been ammended.
